Environment requirement: Anaconda2, hdf5storage, pytorch 0.3.1 

The test images are in the test_imgs folder.
The test_model1.py, test_model2.py and test_model3.py generate the reconstructed hyperspectral images respectively.
And then, the ensemble.py will utilize the three results to generate the final results.
The final reconstructed results are shown in the final_results folder.

You can use the test.sh to finish them in one time.
